      <h3>Permission to secure treatment</h3>
      <p>
        In the event of an emergency, I authorize New Life Christian Camp Association to secure from any licensed hospital, physician, and/or medical personnel any treatment deemed necessary for me or my minor child/ward's immediate care and agree that I will be responsible for payment of any and all medical services rendered. I understand that this authorization includes transporting my child by ambulance if necessary to the nearest medical treatment facility or hospital if I am unable to be reached first.
      </p>

      <h3>Release of liability and permission to secure treatment</h3>
      <p>
        I recognize and acknowledge that there are certain risks of physical injury to participants in the above program(s) and I agree to assume the full risk of any injuries, damages, or loss regardless of severity which I or my minor child/ward may sustain as a result of participating in any and all activities connected with or associated with such program(s). I agree to waive and relinquish all claims I or my minor child/ward may have against New Life Christian Camp Association, its officers, agents, volunteers, and employees as a result of participation in the program. I do hereby fully release and discharge New Life Christian Camp Association, its officers, agents, volunteers, and employees from any and all claims from injury, damage, or loss with the activities of the program(s). I further agree to indemnify and hold harmless and defend New Life Christian Camp Association and its officers, agents, volunteers, and employees from any and all claims resulting from injuries, damages, or losses sustained by me or my minor child/ward arising out of, connected with, or in any way associated with the activities of the program(s).
